      "quote": "Recent code large language models (LLMs) have shown promising performance in generating standalone functions. However, they face limitations in repository-level code generation due to their lack of awareness of repository-level dependencies (e.g., user-defined attributes), resulting in dependency errors such as undefined-variable and no-member errors. In this work, we introduce ToolGen, an approach that integrates autocompletion tools into the code LLM generation process to address these dependencies. ToolGen comprises tw"

To facilitate this evaluation, we create a benchmark comprising 671 real-world code repositories and introduce two new dependency-based metrics: Dependency Coverage and Static Validity Rate. The results demonstrate that ToolGen significantly improves Dependency Coverage by 31.4%3 1 . 4 \\%31.4% to 39.1%3 9 . 1 \\%39.1% and Static Validity Rate by 44.9%4 4 . 9 \\%44.9% to 57.7%5 7 . 7 \\%57.7% across the three LLMs, while"
